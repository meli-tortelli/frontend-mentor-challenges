## Time tracking dashboard app.

<p>Challenge took from Frontend Mentor's website. <p>

<p>I followed the style guide provided but made some changes which fit my  personal preference style. </p> 

- [x] Only HTML and CSS
- [x] Follow the style guide
- [x] Semantic html
- [x] Use css variables
- [x] Use breakpoints for 375 and 1200 width (mobile - desktop)
- [x] Use flexbox and/or grid template to organize the layout
    - [x] cards for user information 
    - [x] cards for each activity the user created to track
- [x] Elements crentralized 
- [x] Personal touch

<p> I pretend to revisity this project and refactor my css stylesheet to Sass and add functionalities with javascript, so it's a ongoing frontend project.</p>
